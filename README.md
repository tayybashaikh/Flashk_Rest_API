# Task 4 – Flask REST API (Python Developer Internship)

## Overview
In this task, I created a simple *REST API using Flask* that performs basic user management operations.  
The API supports *GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE* requests and stores user data in an in-memory Python list.

##Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask  
- Thunder Client (VS Code) for API Testing

## ✔ What I Built
- A REST API with 4 endpoints  
- In-memory storage for users  
- API responses in JSON format  
- Full CRUD operations:

  - *PUT* → Update an existing user  
  - *DELETE* → Remove a user
